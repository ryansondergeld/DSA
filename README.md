## Basic Terminology

###### Algorithm
A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.  

###### Data Structure
A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently.  Common structures would include arrays, lists, and trees.  

###### Time Complexity
A measure of how much time an algorithm takes to run (depends on the amount of data the algorithm has to work on)

###### Space Complexity
A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm takes to run (depends on the amount of data the algorithm has to work on)  

###### Big O Notation
A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends twoards a particular value or infinity.  Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.

###### Recursion
A programming technique where a function calls itself.  

###### Divide and Conquer
A programming method of solving large problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.

###### Brute Force
A very basic algorithm that simply tries all possibilities
